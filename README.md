# Minesweeper
This project is a minesweeper clone made in C++ using SFML. The project features a working minesweeper game and a choice between generating random boards or loading premade debug boards. This project was made for the class Advanced Programming Fundamentals (COP3504C).

For the most significant code the I wrote see the following scripts:
- [Minesweeper.cpp](Minesweeper.cpp)
- [GameState.cpp](GameState.cpp)
